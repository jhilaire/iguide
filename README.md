## Description
This R Shiny application is an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) to operate GUIDE.

Wei-Yin Loh describes GUIDE as follow:  

> GUIDE is a multi-purpose machine learning algorithm for constructing classification and regression trees. It is designed and maintained by Wei-Yin Loh at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. GUIDE stands for Generalized, Unbiased, Interaction Detection and Estimation.
> Development of GUIDE is supported in part by research grants from the U.S. Army Research Office, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Eli Lilly, IBM, and Pfizer.

The current version of iGUIDE uses GUIDE version 24.6 (26/02/2017).
